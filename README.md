# Training simple classification algorithms for Machine Learning

To sum up what exactly we'll be doing here, we are going to build an intuition for machine learning algorithms. We'll be using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to read in, process, and visualize our data. Finally, implementing few classification algorithms in Python
